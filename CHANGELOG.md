# Changes
## 0.2.4

## 0.2.3 (2023/10/26)
* Heuristics H1v3 & H1v4 provided by Eriky Marciano

## 0.2.2 (2023/10/26)
* Fixed bug that could select inappropriate vertex in the list of candidate vertices in the H2v2 & H3v2 heuristics
* Fixed bug in heuristic 4 where the closeness list for candidate vertices was defined as a list of integers, changed to a list of floats
* Added new parameters --alg & --tra, now you can select the closeness method to be used (ALG, uses the algebraic method to calculate the closeness of the vertices and TRA, the method traverses the vertices of the graph to define the closeness value)
* Heur√≠sticas H1v2, H2v2, H3v2, and all H4 now benefit from the implemented --alg and --tra parameters
