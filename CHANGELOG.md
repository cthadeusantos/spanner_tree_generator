# changes

## 0.1.2.3-alpha (2023/02/26)
* Change init measure point with chronos before lower bound calc
* Fixed wrong split threads at  closeness_centrality_thread
* Add thread_importanceV2 and vertex_importanceV2
Now we estimate vertex_importance
* Add new heuristic4v2 (now R1 & R2)
R1 accurately calculates the importance of vertice
R2 R1 calculates through estimation the importance of vertice
* Batteries added

## 0.1.2.3-alpha (2023/02/19)
* Class Parameters added

## 0.1.2.2-alpha (2023/02/19)
