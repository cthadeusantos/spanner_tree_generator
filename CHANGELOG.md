# Changes

## 0.2.10 (2024/02/18)
* The variable total_trees in Graph class has been changed from signed int 32 bits to unsigned long long int 64 bits, fixing the issue of the final sum of total trees being negative in some cases.

## 0.2.9 (2024/02/16)
* Added help message after the warning 'No input redirection detected.'.
* Comment line DEBUG std::cerr << "Running on Linux" << std::endl; in ctfunctions2.cpp which could insert the message into the output file in debug mode.
* Comment line DEBUG std::cerr << "Running on macOS" << std::endl; in ctfunctions2.cpp which could insert the message into the output file in debug mode.
* Added warning "I cannot read the input file on this operating system. Please contact the developers." if unsupported operating system detected.

## 0.2.8 (2024/02/16)
* Fixed the issue that caused the insertion of the message 'Running on Linux/Mac/Win' into the output file of the application, causing an error that halted the execution of the battery files.

## 0.2.7 (2024/01/28)
* Now the code compile and running at MacOS
* Added Makefile for OSX.
* Fixed segmentation fault, trace trap when running at MacOS.
* Update split_filename_v2() and get_filename_v2() again for compatibility reasons between Linux and MacOS.
* Replace (int)INFINITY to std::numeric_limits<int>::max() for compatibility reasons between Linux and MacOS.

* Replaced get_current_dir_name() with get_current_dir() in main_create_graphs.cpp, correcting an error in the function name associated with DIR_BASE.
