name: string                      #The name of the execution battery.
problem: string                   #The problem that will be loaded in the loader.py.
description: string               #Optional parameter. A simple description of the execution battery for log purposes.
exec: string                      #The executable name.
default_args: string              #Optional parameter. The argument line that will be passed to every execution, unless overriden [see below]. 
default_timelimit: integer        #Hard time limit in seconds for the executable. The script will close the application if it takes that long to execute a single run. May be overriden [see below].
default_starting_seed: integer    #Optional parameter. Seed to start the battery. Each individual run of the specified instance will start with this seed and the script will increment it by 1 for every subsequent execution. For example, the first execution will have this seed, the next one will be seed+1, and so on. May be overriden [see below].
default_iterations: integer       #The number of runs that each instance will be executed. May be overriden [see below].
instance_list:                    #List that should contain what instances will be executed with their respective configuration to override the parameters above if necessary.
- instance: string                #The instance that will be executed in this battery. This name is required. But the parameters below it are all optional. The user may use them to override the defaults.
  timelimit: integer              #Optional parameter to override the default timelimit in seconds.
  iterations: integer             #Optional parameter to override the default quantity of executions.
  args: string                    #Optional parameter to override the default argument list that will be passed to the executable.
  starting_seed: integer          #Optional parameter to override the default starting seed. This will be used only for the respective instance.
